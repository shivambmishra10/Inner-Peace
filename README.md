# :droplet: Inner Peace :droplet: - A Wellness Web App

:seedling: Deployed to netlify. You can take a look here: https://inner-peace.netlify.app/

:seedling: Inner Peace is a group project by Jonathan and Tanja, two junior web developers in the making. We used React and CSS, and maaany other useful packages (https://mui.com/ was one of them). Some of the hooks we used for the first time are useContext and useHistory. UseContext proved to be extremely useful and our colleague, Dennis wrote an insightful article about it, which you can find here https://dev.to/dennisvn/react-tsx-passing-props-with-usecontext-beginner-guide-part-12-53g1

:seedling: The aspect we're most proud of is the planning. Every week was carefully planed using Todoist (https://todoist.com) with concrete daily and weekly goals. We had meetings every day, some online, and two days a week in real life. We planned objectives around those two days sometimes, leaving them open for the tasks we had to do together, like creating the JSON file and figuring out how to pass props and use useContext. Jonathan was in charge of the Breathing, Guidance and Help page, as well as the intro pages. Tanja worked on the Entries, Experience, Feeling and Grounding page. However, we also helped each other whenever a problem occurred on any of the pages.
