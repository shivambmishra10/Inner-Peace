# Inner Peace - A Wellness Web App

# Inner Peace

Inner Peace is a wellness web app developed using React, CSS, and various useful packages. It aims to provide users with a platform to explore different aspects of well-being and find inner peace. The app offers features like breathing exercises, guidance, journaling entries, and more.

## Deployment

The Inner Peace app is deployed on Netlify. You can access it [here](https://inner-peace.netlify.app/).

## Features and Technologies

- Built with React and CSS, leveraging packages such as [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) for enhanced UI components.
- Utilized React hooks like `useContext` and `useHistory` to manage state and navigation.
- Planning and goal setting were integral parts of the development process. Weekly goals and tasks were organized using [Todoist](https://todoist.com) to ensure a structured workflow.

## Contributions and Collaboration

Inner Peace is the result of collaborative efforts by a team of web developers. We value the power of teamwork and supporting each other throughout the development process.

## Project Highlights

One aspect we are particularly proud of is the thorough planning process. Each week, we carefully set goals and tasks, which were tracked using Todoist. Regular meetings were conducted to discuss progress and resolve challenges. This approach helped us stay organized and focused.

To gain insights into the implementation of certain features in Inner Peace, we have written a detailed article on using `useContext` in React. You can find the article [here](https://dev.to/dennisvn/react-tsx-passing-props-with-usecontext-beginner-guide-part-12-53g1).
